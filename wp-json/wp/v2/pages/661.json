Our audience is a diverse mix of frontend and full-stack developers, designers and UX specialists, sysadmins and devops engineers, product and project managers and product stakeholders who are interested in web performance.<\/p>\n<h3>Topics<\/h3>\n<p>In particular we\u2019re looking for these types of talk: i) Real life case studies where you\u2019ve worked through and solved challenges you think your peers may share ii) High level sessions on new and disruptive technologies and tools<\/p>\n<p>We aim to have a balance of topics across the year, but here are some themes that we think would make for interesting talks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coping with regulation, Brexit and GDPR<\/li>\n<li>Distributed processing \/ edge computing<\/li>\n<li>Case studies and war stories<\/li>\n<li>Benchmarking<\/li>\n<li>Debugging and build tools<\/li>\n<li>Performance metrics, monitoring and testing<\/li>\n<li>Caching<\/li>\n<li>Protocols<\/li>\n<li>Security<\/li>\n<li>Formats and data encoding<\/li>\n<li>New performance-related web standards<\/li>\n<li>Resilience and chaos engineering<\/li>\n<li>Performance testing<\/li>\n<li>Perceived Performance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Although this is a web performance meet-up, not every single talk needs to be specifically about web perf. If you have a great idea for a talk that would be relevant to our audience but that\u2019s about a different topic, submit it anyway! We are also open to \u201cwildcards\u201d \u2013 something that doesn\u2019t necessarily exactly fit the description of the themes and topics above, but you feel would be interesting, inspiring or entertaining for our attendees.<\/p>\n<p>And of course, you can feel free to submit more than one talk idea!<\/p>\n<h3>Experience Level<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019re open to anyone, from beginners to conference veterans. Many first time LWP speakers have gone on to speak at other events and conferences. If you are nervous about speaking for the first time we will help you every step of the way.<\/p>\n<h3>Language<\/h3>\n<p>All talks must be delivered in English.<\/p>\n<h3>Talk Duration<\/h3>\n<p>We welcome submissions for talks of varying lengths.\u00a0 In general, we shoot for about 20 minutes, which is a good length to hold the attention of the room and also to deliver plenty of useful insights.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on what we have scheduled for any single event, we will try to mix and match talks up to a maximum duration of 90 minutes, but typically each meet-up lasts for 60 minutes of introduction and talks and 90 minutes of socialising\/networking with food and drink provided.<\/p>\n<h3>Slides and equipment<\/h3>\n<p>We have modern projection, video and audio facilities with USBC, HDMI, VGA, Mini DisplayPort and 3.5mm audio connections. You can either bring your own laptop (and connection dongle) or supply a Powerpoint, Keynote, or Web-based presentation (eg Google Slides) for us to run on a show machine. For the speaker there is a choice between a wireless microphone headset and a wired hand mic and we can also get audio from your machine into the speakers via 3.5mm audio jack, if needed.<\/p>\n<p>With your permission, we live stream most talks, and the resulting video, plus your slide deck are published on our website a couple of days after the talk.<\/p>\n<h3>Code of conduct<\/h3>\n<p>We have a code of conduct for speakers and attendees at LDNWebPerf and details can be found at <a href=\"https:\/\/ldnwebperf.org\/code-of-conduct\/\">https:\/\/ldnwebperf.org\/code-of-conduct\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button\" href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSdaJLvOYnU5crzvhH6NF-f1q_Nvl31Ny87uI-k1I190evN21Q\/viewform?usp=sf_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Submit your talk<\/a> <a class=\"button\" href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLScr5Srr7_UafmZ7Dukcd1o47cbZ4iiGGx_XRQ5GYtpZIHTabg\/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Recommend someone else<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Submit your own talk Recommend someone else FAQ &#8211; Speaking At LDNWebPerf Audience London Web Performance is a meet-up for the tech community in London that focuses on web and infrastructure performance.
